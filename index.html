    <p> The wind phone (風の電話, kaze no denwa) is an unconnected telephone booth in Ōtsuchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan, where visitors can hold one-way conversations with deceased loved ones. According to Sasaki, the wind phone was not designed with any specific religious connotation, but rather as a way to reflect on his loss. In an interview, he stated, "Because my thoughts couldn't be relayed over a regular phone line, I wanted them to be carried on the wind."
      <p>My grandmother passed away in 2017, and there's so much I still wanted to tell her. I changed a lot, and started to learn new things and meet new people. So I made this blog to share my thoughts and memories with her. Maybe one day, she will let me hear her voice again.</p>
